Verse 1:
In the moonlit night, where dreams take flight,
Underneath the stars, our spirits ignite.
Whispers in the breeze, secrets they entwine,
A melody of love, in this moment, divine.

Chorus:
Oh, dance with me under the silver glow,
In the moonlit night, where emotions flow.
Our hearts entwined, like a celestial art,
In the quiet magic, where love's sparks start.

Verse 2:
Shadows waltz, as the night unfolds,
A story written, in the stars it's told.
Glimmering hopes, like diamonds above,
In the moonlit night, we find our love.

Chorus:
Oh, dance with me under the silver glow,
In the moonlit night, where emotions flow.
Our hearts entwined, like a celestial art,
In the quiet magic, where love's sparks start.

Bridge:
Through the echoes of the night, our laughter rings,
In the symphony of love, where the heart sings.
Hold me close, let the world slip away,
In the moonlit night, forever we'll stay.

Chorus:
Oh, dance with me under the silver glow,
In the moonlit night, where emotions flow.
Our hearts entwined, like a celestial art,
In the quiet magic, where love's sparks start.

Outro:
As the dawn breaks, our dreams take flight,
In the memory of the moonlit night.
Forever etched, in the canvas of time,
A love story written, in this poetic rhyme.
